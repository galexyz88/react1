Mainland Furniture Website built using the React 
Framework.

The objective of the project was to apply what I have learnt over
the holidays on react to a small project over the span of 2-2.5 days.

tech stack: html, css, javascript  (React framework/library)

the project idea was based on my father's business website 
and to make a template of it using React. It was built using
hooks that access data stored in an array in data.js and displayed in components.
items were not hard coded.

the function filterItems filtered the items based on the category of items in data.js and
returned/created a button based on each category which filtered the items.

testing: the website has some reactivity given by css
intial problems deploying it at first. specific react test code not applied
